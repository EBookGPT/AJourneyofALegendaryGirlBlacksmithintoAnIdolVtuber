# Chapter 2: The Early Life of the Legendary Blacksmith

As she set out on her journey to discover rare smithing materials, the Legendary Girl Blacksmith couldn't help but reflect on her past. She thought about how she became a blacksmith in the first place and about her upbringing.

Growing up, she was never interested in the traditional feminine activities that were expected of her. Instead, she was drawn to the craft of blacksmithing. She found herself fascinated by watching her father work the forge, and soon began practicing her own skills. Despite facing discrimination for her gender and being told that blacksmithing was not a suitable pursuit for a girl, she persisted and eventually became a renowned blacksmith in her own right.

It was during this period of reflection that she realized how much she missed the excitement and challenge of being a blacksmith. This realization gave her the motivation she needed to embark on her journey, which would take her down a winding path filled with adventure and new experiences.

Little did she know, her skills as a blacksmith would soon come in handy in her unexpected foray into the world of virtual entertainment.

As the Legendary Girl Blacksmith set out on her journey, she found herself feeling a bit lost. She walked and walked for what seemed like hours, until she stumbled upon a rabbit hole. 

Without hesitation, she jumped right in! As she fell and fell, she felt like she was in a dream. The walls of the hole were constantly changing color, and strange creatures with hammer-like heads and tongs for hands were dancing all around her!

Finally, she landed in a room filled with doors of all shapes and sizes. She spotted one small door that looked just her size and decided to give it a try.

As she opened the door, she found herself in a beautiful meadow. She could hear the sound of ringing anvils and clashing hammers in the distance. Curious, she followed the sound until she arrived at a large, magnificent forge. 

As she entered, she was greeted by the sight of a wise, old blacksmith working at the forge.
