# Explanation of Code

To bring the Alice in Wonderland trippy story to life, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

First, we used HTML to create the structure of our web page. We utilized divs as containers for our story and given them unique IDs to be used in styling with CSS. 

We used CSS to create the visual elements for our story. We achieved the "trippy" effect by utilizing CSS animations and transitions. We also used various CSS selector combinations to target specific elements, such as the social media icons, and apply custom styles to them. 

Finally, we used JavaScript to add functionality to our story. We used it to create a button to progress through the different chapters and trigger animations upon pressing that button. 

For the appearance of PewDiePie in the story, we utilized an iframe to embed a video of PewDiePie into our web page. 

Overall, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a powerful toolset for creating immersive and interactive stories like A Journey of A Legendary Girl Blacksmith into An Idol Vtuber. By leveraging these technologies, we can bring our story to life in a way that engages and entertains our audience.
