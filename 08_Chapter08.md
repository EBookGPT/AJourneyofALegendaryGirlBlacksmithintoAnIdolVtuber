# Chapter 8: Building a Brand - A Trippy Tale

Our legendary girl blacksmith began to feel like she was Alice in Wonderland, tumbling down a rabbit hole.

She found herself in a strange world of colors, shapes and sounds, as she tried to figure out how to build her personal brand as an idol Vtuber.

As she wandered through this bizarre land, she stumbled upon a caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom. "Who are you?" the caterpillar asked, as it puffed on a hookah.

"I'm a blacksmith turned idol Vtuber, trying to build my personal brand," our heroine replied.

The caterpillar smiled and blew smoke rings. "Ah, building a brand is like growing a mushroom. You have to start with a strong foundation, the mycelium, and then add layers to create a unique, flavorful cap."

The blacksmith scratched her head. "I don't understand. What's my mycelium?"

"Why, it's your core values," the caterpillar explained. "Your passion, your authenticity, your honesty. These are the roots that will anchor your brand."

The blacksmith nodded, as she took in this advice. "But how do I add layers to my brand?"

"You must express yourself through visuals, sound and personality," the caterpillar went on. "Your style, your voice, your content. These are the layers that will give your brand depth and character."

Feeling inspired, our heroine continued on her journey through Wonderland, taking note of all the strange and wonderful things she encountered. She observed the quirky personalities of the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter, all of which she incorporated into her own unique image.

As she crafted her brand, she remembered the caterpillar's advice and stayed true to her core values, always pushing herself to deliver quality, innovative content.

Finally, our heroine emerged from Wonderland, confident and ready to take on the world as an idol Vtuber with a powerful, authentic brand.
# Code Used to Resolve the Alice in Wonderland Trippy Story

In the journey to build a personal brand, our heroine, the legendary girl blacksmith-turned Vtuber, faced many challenges as she navigated a strange, new world.

Fortunately, she was well-equipped with the tools and skills necessary to overcome these obstacles.

Here are some of the key pieces of code she used to resolve the Alice in Wonderland trippy story.

## 1. Core Values

```python
mycelium = ["passion", "authenticity", "honesty"]
```

The caterpillar had advised our heroine that her "mycelium," or core values, would be the foundation of her brand. She embraced this advice and created a list of her own core values that would guide her every decision and action.

## 2. Visual Identity

```css
.logo {
  font-family: 'Wonderland', serif;
  font-size: 50px;
  color: purple;
}

.quirky-style {
  background-color: pink;
  border: 5px solid teal;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

As she traveled through Wonderland, the blacksmith observed the whimsical colorful designs of the characters and incorporated that into her own visual identity. She used CSS to style her logo and created a "quirky-style" to make her content stand out.

## 3. Personality

```javascript
let personality = "Authentic, fun-loving, and hardworking.";
```

To build a brand that resonated with her fans, the blacksmith knew she had to show her authentic self. She expressed her personality in her tone of voice, content creation, and interaction with fans.

Ultimately, by using these codes, our heroine was able to build a powerful and unique brand that set her apart from the crowd and earned her a place in the hearts of fans. These coding lessons prove that the journey to building a brand is a trippy yet rewarding process, much like a wild journey through Wonderland!
