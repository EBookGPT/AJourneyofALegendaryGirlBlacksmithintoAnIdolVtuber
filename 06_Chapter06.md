# Chapter 6: Developing a Fanbase - Code Explanation

The Alice in Wonderland trippy story symbolizes the journey of our legendary girl blacksmith to develop a strong fanbase in Vtubing. Let us delve into the code used to represent and resolve the story.

```python
if fanbase_development == True:
    development_success = True
    while development_success:
        engage_with_fans()
        organize_fan_events()
        interact_on_social_media()
        show_appreciation()
        monitor_metrics()
else:
    development_success = False
    modify_fan_engagement_strategy()
    fanbase_development = True
```

The above code segment represents the process our protagonist underwent to develop a loyal and supportive fanbase. If the `fanbase_development` variable is set to true, the `development_success` variable is initialized to true as well. A while loop is utilized to carry out the different processes involved in fanbase development, such as engaging with fans, organizing fan events, and monitoring metrics. This loop will run until the `development_success` variable is set to false.

If the fanbase development process fails or is not initiated initially, the `development_success` variable is set to false. The `modify_fan_engagement_strategy()` function is called to modify the current fan engagement strategy so that a better plan can be formulated. After the strategy is modified, the `fanbase_development` variable is set to true, and the fanbase development process is initiated once again.

Overall, the code represents the various steps involved in fanbase development, and how it is a recursive and consistent process that requires constant engagement with fans and monitoring of metrics to ensure continued success.
